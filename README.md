# TopShelf-Recipes
This is a simple recipe website created from scratch (HTML/CSS), hosted using Netlify.   
    
### Why?   
--- 
Well, this was a good personal project to test my skills at HTML, CSS, and possibly Javascript in the future. I think that doing this really boosted my confidence in programming in general! It was really fun, too!   
   
I actually here this from a lot of people and I kind of stick by it:   
>"*Just use what you've learned and.. make something! Use what you got! It's the best way to learn.*" 
   
I particularly like this quote and, again, try to stick by that. I don't think it only applies to just coding either. I think this could be said for a lot of different things. I also try to spread this quote/philosophy/whatever you want to call as much as I can.   
   
### The Code 
--- 
The code is *mostly* just CSS (around 60% (currently)), but there's still a decent amount of HTML. Most of the HTML, however, consists of the same repeating `recipe-card` layout.
